        <h1>Lotto Number Strategies and Tips</h1>
        <p>While lotto numbers are drawn randomly, here are some popular strategies that people use to pick their numbers. Remember, these are for fun and do not guarantee a win!</p>
        
        <h2>1. The Wheeling System</h2>
        <p>This strategy involves choosing a larger group of numbers and then creating multiple combinations of these numbers. This increases your chances of winning smaller prizes if some of your chosen numbers are drawn.</p>

        <h2>2. Hot and Cold Numbers</h2>
        <p>Some people analyze past lottery results to find "hot" numbers (numbers that are drawn frequently) and "cold" numbers (numbers that haven't been drawn in a while). The idea is to either play the hot numbers, believing they will continue to appear, or play the cold numbers, believing they are overdue.</p>

        <h2>3. Odd and Even Numbers</h2>
        <p>A balanced mix of odd and even numbers is a common strategy. It's rare for all winning numbers to be either all odd or all even, so many players try to have a 3/3 or 2/4 split.</p>
